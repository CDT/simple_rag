# âœ… PDF-Parse Issue FIXED!

## What Was the Problem?

The `pdf-parse` package had a bug where it tried to load a test PDF file (`test/data/05-versions-space.pdf`) when imported, causing the server to crash on startup.

## The Solution

Changed from **static import** to **dynamic import** in `documentProcessor.js`:

```javascript
// OLD (caused error):
import pdfParse from 'pdf-parse';

// NEW (fixed):
async extractTextFromPdf(filePath) {
  // Dynamic import - only loads when actually processing a PDF
  const pdfParse = (await import('pdf-parse')).default;
  // ... rest of code
}
```

Now `pdf-parse` only loads when you actually upload a PDF file, not when the server starts!

## âœ“ Server is Ready to Start

Your `.env` file has been created. To start the server:

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
ChromaDB collection initialized successfully
```

## Before You Start

**Important**: If you want to use the DeepSeek AI features, edit `backend/.env` and replace:
```
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
```

With your actual API key from https://platform.deepseek.com

(The server will start without it, but chat functionality won't work until you add a real key)

## Test It Works

Once the server is running, open a new terminal and test:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

You should get: `{"status":"ok","message":"RAG Backend is running"}`

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Backend fixed and ready
2. Install frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
4. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`

Enjoy your RAG application! ðŸš€
